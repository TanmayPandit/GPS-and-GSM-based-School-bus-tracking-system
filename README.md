# GPS-and-GSM-based-School-bus-tracking-system
This project is Arduino based school bus tracking system.  It uses GSM for communication between user and device. It can be used for multiple tracking application due to its compact size. It also has functionalities such as geofencing for added safety. With the compatible mobile app, it becomes more user-friendly. Module used for communication and GPS is SIM808 by SIMcom. For computation Arduino uno is used.
Mobile application is made using thunkable for flexiblity.
